Paths
-----


Servers have collections of `roots`, used to abstract away the
location of files.  Most methods take a `path` argument, which can
take three forms:

* `Starting with a /`: An absolute path, not relative to `root`.
* `Containing a /`: The `root` is up to the first slash, and the remaining is a subpath.
* `Not containing a /`: Just a `root` directory.

Available Servers
-----------------



Abstract Servers



* `DiskServer`: A server with a unique ID and a collection of named file root directories.
* `SizelessServer` (`DiskServer`): The main top-level server class, able to transfer data and run commands.  Does not monitor or limit data usage (hence, "sizeless").
* `SizelessConnectableServer` (`SizelessServer`): A server that has a protocol for connecting to it.
* `SizelessLinuxServer` (`SizelessConnectableServer`): A standard Linux server, with everything except `run_command` implemented.
* `ParamikoServer` (`SizelessLinuxServer`): A server connected through ssh, using the Paramiko interface.  The `self.session` variable needs to be set in the `connect` method before these functions will work.

Concrete Servers



* `LocalServer` (`SizelessServer`): A server representing the local machine, using python commands.
* `LoginServer` (`ParamikoServer`): A server using a Paramiko ssh connection, with a normal password login.
